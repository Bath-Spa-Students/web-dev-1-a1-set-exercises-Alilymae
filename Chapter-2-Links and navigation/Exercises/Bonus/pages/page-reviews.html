                            It's a different Conjuring, trying and innovating, not only in the story (no haunted house here) <br>
                            but also in the use of camera/direction, where we feel that we have a new director and with a <br>
                            different identity (good).The scaries don't work as well as in the first two films and the new <br>
                            characters aren't as intriguing as The Nun or Annabelle, so, even if we still have very strong <br>
                            horror moments, we don't feel the same tension as we felt in the previous two. The Warrens do, once <br>
                            again, a fantastic job and I loved some references to The Shining or A Nightmare on Elm Street.

                            Everyone who's complaining that they're too much story and not enough scares, are you kidding? <br>
                            Story and character is the reason why we care about the stakes-that's where drama, tension and <br>
                            horror comes from. If it was all jump scares and lacking in story (the movie Winchester comes to <br>
                            mind), I guarantee y'all would've been even more disappointed. But if that's your thing, you'll <br>
                            probably be just as entertained by a jack in the box. While remaining faithful to the Conjuring <br>
                            universe, I appreciated that this third movie explored new territory so it wasn't just a repeat. <br>
                            It is a quality addition to the series with good production value, and much more <br>
                            ughtfully-written than the spin offs. It's a win for what it is considering the impossible task <br>
                            the writer and the director had of pleasing all these harsh fans who couldn't even tell you what <br>
                            they liked about the first two conjuring movies other than "it was scary."

                        <h5>James Wan failed Farmiga and Wilson</h5>
                        <p>
                            In the end, Farmiga and Wilson make their parts work, and Chaves doesn't straight up suck,<br>
                            but there is lack of "magic" in this one. The production, the acting, the sound, is all great,<br>
                            but the writing and more importantly the talent to tell a horror story "based on reality" <br>
                            (slightly based on reality) is just not there here.
